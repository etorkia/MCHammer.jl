# Distribution Fitting

Distribution fitting is the process of selecting and parameterizing a probability distribution that best describes observed data. Analysts accomplish this by comparing empirical data against theoretical distributions, adjusting parameters to minimize discrepancies. Methods often include statistical tests (e.g., Kolmogorov-Smirnov, Anderson-Darling), visual assessments (e.g., histograms, Q-Q plots), and numerical criteria (e.g., AIC, BIC, or log-likelihood).

## Fitting Correctly

### Practical Applications for Analysts

Distribution fitting is foundational for analysts across various fields:

- **Risk Management & Finance:**  
  Analysts fit distributions to asset returns or operational loss data to estimate Value at Risk (VaR), conduct stress testing, and manage financial risks.

- **Reliability Engineering:**  
  By fitting failure-time data (such as machine lifetimes) to distributions like Weibull or Lognormal, analysts predict product lifespan and develop appropriate maintenance schedules.

- **Quality Control:**  
  Analysts use fitted distributions to monitor manufacturing processes, identifying deviations from expected behaviors to maintain quality standards.

- **Environmental Modeling:**  
  Distribution fitting helps predict extreme weather events, flood frequency, and environmental risks by modeling historical weather data or natural phenomena.

- **Decision Analysis & Simulation:**  
  Analysts model uncertainty in decision-making contexts by fitting distributions to historical data, enabling realistic simulations (e.g., Monte Carlo simulations) for strategic planning.

### Caveats of Fitting Distributions Empirically

Despite its usefulness, empirical distribution fitting has important limitations:

- **Data Quantity and Quality:**  
  Small or noisy datasets may lead to unstable parameter estimates, resulting in unreliable conclusions.

- **Outliers and Extreme Values:**  
  Extreme observations can significantly influence the fitted distribution parameters, potentially distorting insights unless handled appropriately.

- **Overfitting Risk:**  
  Analysts might select overly complex distributions that closely fit historical data but generalize poorly to new observations, limiting predictive power.

- **Misinterpretation of Statistical Tests:**  
  Statistical tests like Kolmogorov-Smirnov or Anderson-Darling can indicate a good fit even when practical considerations (such as data context) suggest otherwise, or vice versa.

- **Subjective Judgment:**  
  Empirical fitting often requires subjective judgment when choosing between multiple similarly good fits, potentially introducing bias or inconsistency.

### Importance of Selecting Appropriate Distributions Beforehand

Understanding appropriate theoretical distributions prior to analysis is crucial:

- **Domain Knowledge:**  
  Analysts familiar with the underlying process or theoretical context of the data (e.g., finance, engineering, biology) can immediately focus on distributions that are known to realistically model the phenomena.

- **Statistical Properties:**  
  Different distributions have distinct properties such as skewness, kurtosis, tail heaviness, and bounds. Analysts must select distributions that inherently align with these features of the data.

- **Avoiding Mis-Specification:**  
  Selecting inappropriate distributions can lead to misinterpretation of risk, poor resource allocation, or misguided policy decisions. Knowledgeable selection beforehand reduces the likelihood of such errors.

- **Interpreting Results:**  
  Using contextually appropriate distributions enhances the interpretability of model parameters, helping stakeholders more clearly understand risks, probabilities, and implications of the analysis.

When used carefully, distribution fitting is a valuable analytical tool enabling informed decision-making under uncertainty. However, analysts must carefully consider data quality, model complexity, and theoretical context to ensure robust, meaningful insights from their fitted distributions.

Random.seed!(42)
sample_data = randn(1000)
fit_result = viz_fit(sample_data)

```

## Fit vs Data Stats

```@example fit_stats
# Generate sample data from a LogNormal distribution
using Distributions, MCHammer, Random #hide
Random.seed!(42)
sample_data = rand(LogNormal(0, 1), 1000)
fits = fit_stats(sample_data)
show(fits, allrows=true, allcols=true)

```

## Automatic Fitting
